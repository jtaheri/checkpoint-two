            After graduating college in 2013 with a business degree, I embarked on a career in consulting. Like many recent graduates, I had little direction or idea of what I wanted to do with my life. My knack for analytical problem solving and collaborating with other people lead me to spend the first few years of my a career in client service related positions. Then from December 2015 through March 2017 I took some time off work to care for a family member. In March 2017 I relocated to Austin to resume my career.

            I am currently a Customer Service Representative for Allergan Pharmaceuticals. I am the sole manager of web support and online platform education for National Accounts. I analyze and resolve client issues related to online services and support field sales representatives through client on boarding and consulting. I am also working towards a Full Stack JavaScript Certification through Austin Coding Academy. When I'm not working or coding, I try to get outside as much as possible (hiking, kayaking, camping, etc.) and of course a healthy serving of Netflix.

            I want to build beautiful, highly intuitive, fun to use web applications. Over the first few years of my career, I have gained many personal insights that helped me to determine the direction I want to take in life. As a direct result of those insights, I began my journey towards a career in web development. I'm excited to work in a field that combines my interests in technology, creativity, and analytical problem solving. Thus far, coding has proved to be a continous learning process that is both challenging and extremely rewarding. In short, I'm stoked to get into this field!
